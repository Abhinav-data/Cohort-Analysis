Cohort Analysis: Retention, Churn, and Product Revenue Overview
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of user retention, churn (lost %), and revenue trends on a monthly cohort basis. Users are grouped by their Onboarding month (acquisition cohort), and their behavior is tracked over subsequent months to understand long-term engagement and revenue contribution.

Cohort Retention & Lost % (Month-wise)
Retention % shows the proportion of users from each cohort who remained active in each month after joining.

Lost % (churn) reflects the percentage of users who became inactive month over month.

This allows for identification of patterns in user engagement and drop-off over time.

Visualized using a cohort matrix (heatmap) for quick insight into retention decay trends.

Total Revenue by Product (Month-wise)
Revenue is segmented by product category and aligned with user cohorts to understand product-level monetization trends.

Enables business teams to assess:

Which products generate the most revenue per cohort
